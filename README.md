Topic:
Internationalize and localize a web app
Workflow:
mark up the HTML: add a new attribute to each string in the HTML that will need localization
create translations: create a new directory in the app's root, and a sub-directory for each language we want to localize. Each sub-directory has a file containing the translations of strings that appear in the app's HTML and JavaScript.
